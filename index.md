## About Me


My name is Jacob Kupperman, and I am currently a sophomore in Cornell University. I am also an aspiring Mechanical Engineer with a Robotics minor. Hence, I am eager to advance my skills in all three facets of robotics (ECE, ME, and CS). In particular, some relevant classes that I am taking this semester are Statics, Thermodynamics, and Functional Programming. Next semester, I am excited to be enrolled in circuits and dynamics which aligns well with my interests because I am most interested in the hardware side of robotics. For my career, I am especially interested in applications of robotics to the agriculture or healthcare industries. 

Some of my favorite passtimes inclue exercising, laying down outside on grass or a rock, and listening to folk rock music. Some of my favorite sceneries include mountainous, forested, lakeside, riverside, seaside, and fieldy areas.
