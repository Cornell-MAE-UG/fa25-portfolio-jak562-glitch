# SLF Lure Pitch

## Problem statement (most important)

Spotted lantern flies gather on grape vines, but they also gather on other plants that we don’t harvest, like the Tree of Heaven to which they are attracted by scent. How can we leverage this unique quality and lure spotted lantern flies to specific locations away from the vineyards to be exterminated?

What challenge currently makes obvious solutions difficult to implement?  
Spotted lantern flies (SLFs) are highly destructive and mobile. They are attracted to multiple environmental cues (scent, vertical structures, electric frequencies, honeydew), and we do not yet know how strongly they prioritize grapes over alternative lures. Additionally, solutions that span entire fields are costly, interfere with harvest operations, and are difficult to scale. We want to narrow the scope to designing a centralized lure-and-kill system that attracts SLFs away from vineyards to a controlled extermination site without disrupting daily vineyard operations.

---

## Impact

Spotted lantern flies have been an invasive species and have destroyed hundreds of grape harvests. If we can limit their destruction, we can save farmers thousands of dollars and reduce food waste.

Rather than creating a tool that spans an entire field, we can make an object that only needs to be placed at a certain location, making it material-wise cheaper and scalable. Because the lure would not span across the field itself, placements can be arranged such that they wouldn’t interfere with existing day-to-day field or harvest operations.

This solution has potential to work for both adult and nymph spotted lanternflies.

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): Decoy Lure on Tree

**What it is:**  
A humidifier-like structure attached to a Tree of Heaven. The humidifier will spray attractive fumes and poisonous fumes/insecticides at a to-be-determined rate. Another possibility is to incorporate the poison as an artificial sap for the humidifier. The diffused scent could attract the SLFs and bait them to drink the sap and be poisoned. Grape Berry Moth Spray is another possible insecticide option.

**How it would be used:**
- Attach the humidifier-like fumigator to a Tree of Heaven, tall pole, or standardized telephone pole.
- Diffuse Tree of Heaven scent and/or other attractive organic compounds.
- Release insecticide or artificial poisonous sap at a controlled rate.
- Attract SLFs away from vineyards to the lure location where they ingest poison and are exterminated.

**Why it’s better than the status quo:**
- Cheaper to create one lure tool to attract SLF and kill them all in one location = scalable.
- Does not interfere with day-to-day field/harvest operations.
- Leverages existing research on SLF attractants rather than starting from scratch.
- Centralizes extermination rather than dispersing chemical treatment across an entire field.

**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:**  
We can build the fumigator attachment that will be added to tall poles, and we can design a linkage that can attach to a standard pole or tree.  

**Minimum Viable Product:**  
A humidifier with a linkage design made to attach to any standardized telephone pole.

### Concept B: High Frequency Hotspot Fence

**What it is:**  
Wrap wires around a fence with decoy grape vines, placed not too close in vicinity to actual grapes. Attach wires to a speaker that plays a signal at exactly 60 Hz.

**How it would be used:**
- Construct a fence structure with wrapped wires.
- Install decoy grape vines to increase visual attraction.
- Play a 60 Hz signal through the wires to mimic electric frequencies from power lines.
- Draw SLFs to the hotspot area for extermination.

---

## Potential

We have research on different things the SLFs are attracted to:
- Electric Frequencies (60 Hz) from Power Lines  
- Scent of Tree of Heaven, organic compounds diffused by the tree  
- Tall, vertical, and dark, warm, or humming objects  
- Drawn to their own "honeydew" (a sugary, sticky, liquid waste) excreted by other nymphs or adults already feeding  

Since we have research on what SLFs are already attracted to, we can use what we know and work closely with the entomologists and research to implement them rather than starting from scratch.

---

## Key risks / unknowns

- SLFs might invade the lured regions and become a problem in a different industry/environment — why it matters: relocation could cause unintended ecological or agricultural damage; how we’ll test it: controlled pilot placements and environmental impact monitoring.
- Requires more manpower to kill when they’re trapped and need to be extracted — why it matters: operational feasibility and labor costs; how we’ll test it: time-motion and labor requirement analysis during pilot.
- Each lure/trap will need to be maintained since they can’t hold infinite amounts of SLFs — why it matters: scalability and maintenance burden; how we’ll test it: measure capture rates and servicing frequency.
- Don’t know how attracted they will be to grapes vs. chemicals/decoy — why it matters: lure effectiveness; how we’ll test it: comparative field trials between vineyard areas and lure zones.
- Catching other bugs/animals — why it matters: ecological harm and regulatory risk; how we’ll test it: species monitoring and selective attractant testing.

## Questions for the client

1. How would you rank the effectiveness of each luring factor we have in our idea (electric frequency, scent of organic compounds, honeydew, scent)?  
   *Decision affected:* Prioritization of attractant development and experimental design.

2. What are different bugs that may be affected by catching spotted lanternflies and what are things we can do to prevent this?  
   *Decision affected:* Selection of insecticide and ecological mitigation strategy.

3. Would it be harmful to the grape vines to plant Trees of Heaven in a nearby vicinity?  
   *Decision affected:* Placement strategy and ecological feasibility.

4. How effective have your current approaches been, and have any of them attempted to lure or bait the flies?  
   *Decision affected:* Benchmarking performance targets and identifying gaps in current solutions.
