Using three pins, I connected the rod and actuator to each other using one pin and each object to the ground using two pins, respectively. I chose the high force rod-style actuator because it has a maximum force of 294 kN. Then, I had to work out how I could supply a maximal force given that the actuator can only direct force parallel to itself. Thus, I determined that I should set the rod at a displacement fo 45 degrees off of the ground. This would allow the actuator to
