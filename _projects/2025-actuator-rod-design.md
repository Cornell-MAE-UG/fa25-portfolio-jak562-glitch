Using three pins, I connected the rod and actuator to each other using one pin and each object to the ground using two pins, respectively. I chose the high force rod-style actuator because it has a maximum force of 294 kN. My design effectively maximizes the vertical load support by optimizing the angles and lengths of the support rods. The rod on the left is angled at approximately 51.65°, which is close to the ideal angle range (45–60°) for maximizing vertical force components while minimizing horizontal thrust. With this geometry, more of the 294 kN force capacity of the rod is directed upward to counteract the load, rather than being wasted in horizontal force. Choosing an angle that is slightly greater than 45 degrees allows the actuator to provide a sizeable vertical force as well as more effectively oppose moments about the bar. Choosing the rod's length to be 70.71 cm ensures that weight attached to the top will be able to reach the vertical limit for the design space as well. This setup ensures a high vertical force component, which translates to greater weight-bearing capability, and takes advantage of the design space limits.
