  The mini fridge, as shown in Fig. 1, functions by rejecting heat from its interior to the outside environment, thereby keeping the interior cool. Inside, the fridge is a refrigerant which travels through a closed loop and is capable of easily switching between liquid and gaseous states. The process begins when the refrigerant passes through the evaporator coils, pictured in Fig. 2, and absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator, transforming the refrigerant into vapor. Next, the compressor uses electric power in order to compress the vapor. This process increases the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant. Then, as the refrigerant goes through the condensor coils, it loses heat and turns back into a liquid. The capillary tube, pictured in the diagram, decreases the pressure of the liquid, further lowering its temperature.
